 ## Basic Structure

 ** main.tf - The main.tf file is where you define the configuration code for creating and managing resources. It contains the Terraform code that specifies what resources to provision and their configurations.

 ** variable.tf - The variables.tf file is used to declare input variables for your Terraform configuration. Variables allow you to parameterize your code and make it reusable. We will cover variables in detail in a later section.

 ** outputs.tf - The outputs.tf file is used to define values that will be exposed as outputs after the Terraform execution. Outputs can be used to retrieve useful information from your infrastructure, such as IP addresses or resource identifiers.


 # Root Module:

  Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used togther

  The root module is the starting point of your Terraform configuration. It represents the top-level directory that contains your infrastructure code. Its main purpose is to define the overall structure of your infrastructure and manage the interactions between different modules and resources. Here are the key benefits of using a root module:
 
  Organizational Structure: The root module provides a structured approach to organizing your infrastructure code. It allows you to define and manage multiple modules and resources within a single configuration, making it easier to navigate and understand your infrastructure layout.

  Input Parameterization: By using variables in the root module, you can make your infrastructure code more flexible and reusable. Variables allow users to provide values specific to their environment or requirements. This makes it easier to deploy the same infrastructure configuration to different environments or with different configurations.

  Dependency Management: The root module specifies the dependencies and relationships between different modules and resources. It ensures that Terraform deploys resources in the correct order to satisfy these dependencies. This helps establish the desired state of your infrastructure and ensures proper resource configuration.

 # Variable :

  A variable is a reusable module that focuses on defining and managing variables used within your Terraform configuration. It provides a centralized location for variable definitions, promoting consistency and simplifying the management of input parameters. 
  
  Here's why variable modules are beneficial:
  
  Centralized Variable Management: By defining variables in a separate module, you can easily manage and update them in one place. This approach reduces duplication and ensures consistent variable usage across your infrastructure code. It also simplifies the process of making configuration changes that affect multiple deployments.

  Encapsulation of Variables: Variable modules encapsulate the complexity of variable assignments, making the root module more focused on the infrastructure configuration itself. It provides an abstraction layer that hides the details of how variables are assigned and used, promoting modularity and making the root module easier to read and maintain.

  Sharing Variables Across Modules: Variable modules can be shared across multiple resource modules, allowing for a standardized set of variables to be used throughout your Terraform configuration. This promotes consistency and makes it easier to propagate changes to variables across different parts of your infrastructure code

 # Child Module:

   A resource module is a reusable module that encapsulates the configuration and logic for a specific set of resources. It represents a logical grouping of related resources, such as virtual machines, databases, or networking components.
   
   Here are the advantages of using resource modules:

   Reusability and Modularity: Resource modules allow you to define and manage a particular type of resource in a reusable manner. You can create a module that provisions and configures a specific resource, and then reuse that module across different deployments. This promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and simplifies the process of provisioning similar resources.

   Encapsulation of Complexity: Resource modules abstract away the low-level details of configuring individual resources. They provide a higher-level interface that simplifies the deployment process for users. By encapsulating the complexity within the module, you can hide implementation details and make the infrastructure code more focused on the desired end result.

   Maintainability and Scalability: With resource modules, you can manage and update resources independently. Each module represents a self-contained unit that can be modified without affecting other parts of your infrastructure code. This improves maintainability and scalability, as you can add or modify resources within a module without impacting the rest of your infrastructure configuration.

   In summary, using root modules, variable modules, and resource modules in Terraform provides a structured and modular approach to managing infrastructure as code.
