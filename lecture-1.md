Title: What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using machine-readable configuration files.
It involves representing infrastructure components, such as servers, networks, and storage, as code.
By defining infrastructure as code, IaC treats infrastructure as software, enabling it to be versioned, tested, and deployed using the same practices used for application code.

Title: Why is IaC Important?

Reproducibility: IaC enables the creation of consistent and reproducible environments by automating the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure resources. With IaC, you can define the desired state of your infrastructure in code and easily recreate it whenever needed.
Scalability: IaC allows you to scale your infrastructure up or down based on demand. By using code to define your infrastructure, you can easily modify resource counts, sizes, or configurations to meet changing requirements.
Efficiency: IaC eliminates manual configuration and reduces human error. With code-based infrastructure provisioning, you can automate the deployment and configuration of resources, saving time and effort.
Collaboration: IaC tools provide a shared codebase and version control, facilitating collaboration between teams. Infrastructure changes can be reviewed, tracked, and deployed in a controlled manner.

Title: IaC Tools - Introducing Terraform

Terraform is a widely used IaC tool that enables infrastructure provisioning and management.
It supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, making it highly versatile.
Terraform uses a declarative language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure configurations.
With Terraform, you define the desired state of your infrastructure in configuration files, and Terraform handles the orchestration and provisioning of the necessary resources.

Title: Benefits of IaC with Terraform

Declarative Language: Terraform uses a declarative approach, where you specify the desired state of your infrastructure without worrying about the implementation details. Terraform then automatically figures out the steps needed to reach that state.
Resource Management: Terraform manages the entire lifecycle of infrastructure resources, including creation, modification, and deletion. It tracks the state of resources and only makes necessary changes to achieve the desired state.
Infrastructure Versioning: Terraform tracks changes to infrastructure configurations and allows you to easily roll back to previous versions. This enables easy experimentation, testing, and reverting changes if needed.
Ecosystem: Terraform has a large and active community, offering a rich ecosystem of modules and integrations with other tools. This allows you to leverage pre-built modules, share code with others, and extend Terraform's functionality.

Title: How Terraform Works

Terraform follows a three-step process: initialize, plan, and apply.
Initialize: The initialization step sets up the working directory, downloads necessary provider plugins, and initializes the Terraform backend. The backend is responsible for storing the state and configuration information securely.
Plan: The planning step generates an execution plan by comparing the desired state specified in the configuration files with the current state of the infrastructure. It shows what changes Terraform will make to reach the desired state.
Apply: The apply step executes the changes necessary to reach the desired state. Terraform creates, modifies, or deletes resources as needed, ensuring that the infrastructure matches the specified configuration.

Title: Terraform Workflow

Develop: Write Terraform configuration files that describe the desired infrastructure state. Specify the resources, their dependencies, and any required configurations.
Initialize: Run the terraform init command to initialize the Terraform project. This step downloads the required provider plugins and sets up the backend.
Plan: Generate a plan by running the terraform plan command. This step compares the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state and shows the actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state.
Apply: Apply the plan by running the terraform apply command. Terraform will create, modify, or delete resources as necessary, based on the defined configuration.
Review and Iterate: Review the changes made by Terraform, iterate on the configuration as needed, and repeat the apply process until the desired state is achieved.
